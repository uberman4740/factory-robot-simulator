--- Performance considerations ---
. Check whether using uint8 is detrimental to performance on GPU compared to using float32 (floatX)

--- Labeled data generation ---  
. Currently, the distribution of the images used for the labeling exercise is quite different than the natural distribution in the game mode.
  Possible advantages: Dense information (e.g. higher fraction of images with humans close to camera)
  Possible drawbacks: The opportunity to "overfit" to the actual situation is wasted.
